This event can occur when the TLDLP core in the root complex detects reliability issues on the link (or a lane simply drops) and must change the link speed or width by doing a 'silent' retrain of the PCIe link to obtain a more stable link operation. This often degrades the link speed and/or width from the original val- ues on the initial link train. Software needs to notified in such cases to be aware of a change in the link health.
